Note: 
The footnote mentions, "The codebook claims that the life challenges index is the average of seven items while Judkins et al. (2022) claims that 
this index is the average of six items". I found the latter to be true, i.e. Life Challenges Index is indeed the average of SIX items.

1 Question: The footnote from analysis plan claims that social support index is available in the 6-year analysis file (DS15). Found it in the PACE SAQ (DS7) itself, is there a need to check for it in DS15?
